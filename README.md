# Kangaroo

The Kangaroo or the JumpyGrof project was a Data Structure Project Assignment

The DS project assignment was on my second semester of my first year in the University Of Malaya, I was the lead project member and github.com/Letsplay-github(Izzat) was the main coder for the project. We also had 3 more several team member which was Kisyok(Responsible for the GUI), Faiz and the other one whom I can't remember (did the exception handling).
